This repository contains my solutions to the first 4 exercises of IBM Quantum Challenge-Fall 2020.

The main repository for the challenge can be viewed here: https://github.com/qiskit-community/IBMQuantumChallenge2020  

For questions of week 2, related to finding the solutions to the 3x3 Lights Out Puzzle, I created the circuits for 2x2 in my local notebooks (for ease of simulation and debugging), which I then scaled up for 3x3 puzzles before submitting. This repo contains the notebooks of the 2x2 lights out solutions.
